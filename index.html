    <h2>Number Facts</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make a request to the Numbers API
        <a href="http://numbersapi.com/">(http://numbersapi.com/)</a> to get a
        fact about your favorite number. Make sure you get back JSON by
        including the json query key, specific to this API.
      </li>
      <li>
        Figure out how to get data on multiple numbers in a single request. Make
        that request and when you get the data back, put all of the number facts
        on the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the API to get 4 facts on your favorite number. Once you have them
        all, put them on the page. It's okay if some of the facts are repeats.
        (Note: You'll need to make multiple requests for this.)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Deck of Cards</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make a request to the Deck of Cards API to request a single card from a
        newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, console.log the value and
        the suit (e.g. “5 of spades”, “queen of diamonds”).
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a request to the deck of cards API to request a single card from a
        newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, make a request to the same
        API to get one more card from the same deck. Once you have both cards,
        console.log the values and suits of both cards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build an HTML page that lets you draw cards from a deck. When the page
        loads, go to the Deck of Cards API to create a new deck, and show a
        button on the page that will let you draw a card. Every time you click
        the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the
        deck.
